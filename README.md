## Overview

Stain variability between slides, scanners, and batches is one of the most common pre-processing challenges in digital pathology. Chameleon provides a clean, GUI-based workflow for correcting this variability using four normalization methods, with a **Pre-flight Inspector** that lets you compare all four methods side by side on your own images before committing to a full batch run.

Available as both a **MATLAB** app (works in MATLAB Online) and a standalone **Python** application.

NOTE: Chameleon will not correct for bad staining. The software is designed to normalized a batch of images to allow subsequent image segmentation to be performed without false positive or false negative detections due to image variations.

## Features

* **Four normalization modes** spanning two algorithms (histogram specification and Reinhard color transfer) with two reference strategies (explicit reference image or batch-derived synthetic reference)
* **Pre-flight Inspector** — preview all four methods on any image in your batch before running, with ◀ ▶ navigation through the full queue
* **Batch-average synthetic reference** — no need to choose a reference slide; Chameleon computes one automatically from your data
* **CSV normalization log** with per-image, per-channel statistics (mean, std, Wasserstein distance or delta-E)
* **Parallel processing** in the Python version (configurable worker count)
* Supports `.tif`, `.tiff`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp` input (case-insensitive)
* MATLAB Online compatible — no desktop installation required

## The Four Modes

|Mode|Algorithm|Reference|Best for|
|-|-|-|-|
|**1**|Histogram matching|User-chosen reference image|Strong correction when you have an ideal reference slide|
|**2**|Histogram matching|Batch-average CDF|Fast, unbiased correction with no reference needed|
|**3**|Reinhard color transfer|User-chosen reference image|Conservative correction; lower artefact risk for IHC|
|**4**|Reinhard color transfer|Batch-average synthetic reference|Unbiased Reinhard normalization; no reference needed|

**Not sure which to use?** Open the Pre-flight Inspector and compare all four visually on your own images before deciding.

### Histogram Specification (Modes 1 \& 2)

Maps each image's per-channel intensity distribution to match a target CDF using a 256-entry lookup table. Fast and deterministic. Mode 2 builds the target by averaging histograms across the entire batch.

### Reinhard Color Transfer (Modes 3 \& 4)

Transfers color statistics in LAB color space using the formula:

```
output = (source − src\_mean) / src\_std × tgt\_std + tgt\_mean
```

More conservative than histogram matching — shifts and scales the distribution without forcing a full shape match. Mode 4 builds the synthetic target by averaging LAB statistics across the entire batch.

## Pre-flight Inspector

![Pre-flight Inspector](docs/preview_screen.png) 

Before running a full batch, click **🔍 Preview All Methods Before Running** to open the inspector. It shows:

* The **original image** on the left
* A **2×2 grid** of all four normalized results — large enough to see staining differences clearly
* **◀ Previous / Next ▶** navigation through every image in your queue
* A **Select method** dropdown and **✔ Apply \& Close** button that sets your chosen mode automatically

Modes 1 and 3 require a reference image to be set. Modes 2 and 4 are always available.

## Installation

### Python version (recommended for standalone use)

```bash
pip install PyQt6 matplotlib numpy scikit-image Pillow
python run\_normalizer.py
```

> \*\*Windows / Anaconda users:\*\* If you encounter a PyQt6 DLL error, install via conda instead:
> ```bash
> conda install -c conda-forge pyqt
> pip install matplotlib scikit-image Pillow
> python run\_normalizer.py
> ```

### MATLAB version

Requires MATLAB R2019b or later with the **Image Processing Toolbox**.

```matlab
run\_Chameleon
```

Works directly in **MATLAB Online** — no desktop installation required.

\---

## Packaging as a Standalone Executable (Python)

No Python installation required on the target machine.

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "Chameleon" run\_normalizer.py
```

The executable will appear in the `dist/` folder.

\---

## Usage

### Recommended workflow

1. Browse to your **input folder** — supported images load automatically
2. For Modes 1 or 3: browse to a **reference image**
3. Browse to an **output folder**
4. Click **🔍 Preview All Methods** to compare all four normalizations side by side
5. Select your preferred method and click **✔ Apply \& Close**
6. Click **▶ Run normalization**

### Choosing a mode

|Situation|Recommended|
|-|-|
|You have one ideal reference slide|Mode 1 (aggressive) or Mode 3 (conservative)|
|No reliable reference image|Mode 2 or Mode 4|
|H\&E, same scanner, moderate batch drift|Mode 2 — fast and effective|
|IHC with variable DAB/haematoxylin ratio|Mode 4 — lower artefact risk|
|Unsure|Open the Pre-flight Inspector and compare visually|

## Outputs

normalized images are saved to the chosen output folder with `\_norm` appended to the filename.

If **Save CSV normalization log** is enabled, a timestamped log is written alongside the images.

### CSV log columns

**Histogram modes (1 \& 2):**
`Filename, Channel (R/G/B), OrigMean, OrigStd, NormMean, NormStd, WassersteinDist`

**Reinhard modes (3 \& 4):**
`Filename, Channel (L/a/b), OrigMean\_LAB, OrigStd\_LAB, NormMean\_LAB, NormStd\_LAB, DeltaE\_mean`

The **Wasserstein distance** quantifies how much the distribution was shifted — higher values indicate images that were strong outliers before normalization. The **delta-E** is the mean per-pixel LAB colour difference between original and normalized.
